# Resume Renderer
The Resume Renderer is a purely client side application developed to allow people to build their resumes without having to upload any of their data into any database. 

## State of Evolution
Right now, the application is in its infancy where we have a basic template that displays a random resume - that of the creator of this application. 
- Build out the export functionality
- This will grow to provide a user interface that accepts inputs using forms and then
- Grow the number of templates that are available

## Technology Stack
- **React** - The UI framework that powers the application
- **TypeScript** - The language of choice for UI development
- **MUI v5** - Components and Themes - Extremely mature and super easy to use
- **Vite** - Build utility that powers development and deployment
- **Zustand** for State Management and persisting the state of application to the browser
- **React Markdown** - Allows for expressing certain content in markdown and provide the ability to render that in accordance to the template and palette of the resume
